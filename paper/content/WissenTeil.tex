\subsection{Theorie}
%rewrite, taken from background sub opencv tutorial, look for correct source
Background subtraction is a major preprocessing step in many vision-based applications. For example, consider the case of a visitor counter where a static camera takes the number of visitors entering or leaving the room, or a traffic camera extracting information about the vehicles etc. In all these cases, first you need to extract the person or vehicles alone. Technically, you need to extract the moving foreground from static background. \\
If you have an image of background alone, like an image of the room without visitors, image of the road without vehicles etc, it is an easy job. Just subtract the new image from the background. You get the foreground objects alone. But in most of the cases, you may not have such an image, so we need to extract the background from whatever images we have. It becomes more complicated when there are shadows of the vehicles. Since shadows also move, simple subtraction will mark that also as foreground. It complicates things. \\
Several algorithms were introduced for this purpose. OpenCV has implemented three such algorithms which are very easy to use. We will see them one-by-one.
